# Seating Maker
I crammed this project in 5 hours. Have mercy on my student coding skills.

To test it out, run `test.js` to generate 30 random students, and calculate their compatibilities.

This is supposed to generate compatibility values between students based on student-provided preferences, and their respective noise values, to be filled in by the teacher or researcher. The program then outputs the respective compatibility values for that student compared to every other student.

Extremely bugged. Extremely broken. Use with caution.

## GUI
The GUI is still in development. And by GUI, I mean a JS express server because HTML will be your GUI.

## Compatibility Equation
I made the equation myself by manually tweaking slider values on GeoGebra, finding the right numbers, then stuffing them into the program. If anyone has a better and more accurate equation, I will be glad to incorporate them into this project.
